# flotation-optimisation

This is my project for the Year 3 Advanced Programming module. I got a mark of 81%.

### Assignment

Write a C/C++ program with geological or geophysical usefulness. You can do any program that you want, but it MUST include the following capabilities and techniques:

<ul>
  <li>Obtain input from the user.</li>
  <li>Load data from a file.</li>
  <li>Save data to a file.</li>
  <li>Carry out calculations.</li>
  <li>Make use of classes and objects.</li>
  <li>Dynamically allocate memory – You can also use stl containers, but I also want to see that you are able to do the memory allocation yourself using new and delete as well.</li>
  <li>Make use of functions to both carry out specific tasks, as well as to break up the code into sensible sections.</li>
</ul>

Credit will be given for the difficulty of the program but remember to choose something that you think you can accomplish as lots of marks will be lost for programs that don’t work.

You must submit your source code, which must include comments (/*...*/ and/or //) that say what the various variables and each section of the program are for. You must also include a 2-page documentation that describes what the program does and how the user should use it. You can give examples of the output as an appendix if it is too long for the page limit.

### Feedback

81% was the highest mark that I gave out. I marked according to the Swanson criteria, which means that a mark of about 65% would be for a code that met the criteria but didn’t do anything special, 70% and above is good and 80% and above is very good.

Your specific feedback was:

“An impressive code that does both good user input etc., as well as a well-programmed set of numerical methods. Decent documentation to accompany it.”
